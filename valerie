Git is a VCS (Version Control System) that is useful for easily tracking your code, allowing you to change it and share it with others to help you with it.
GitHub is a platform to store all of your Git online with an easy-to-use interface, storing all of your code and projects in folders.
Repositories are where your projects are stored, inside a folder. You can work on this repository alone or invite others to work on the project with you, allowing them access to the files.
Cloning is where a repository is created within GitHub, storing it in the cloud. Cloning is just a copy of a repository that can be located on your own personal computer. It makes it simpler to fix issues and remove files. It pulls down the repository data that GitHub has, containing all of the current data that is stored in that file.
Committing and pushing are ways of adding changes to your local machine to the remote repository. This allows the host or teammates to see your latest work when you're ready to share the file with others. You can also add commit messages to remind yourself or teammates of what work you have achieved, just like a personal note to yourself or others that can be removed in the future.
Branches can be used to isolate work that you want to keep separate and not share with others, or just not add it to the final project. It allows you to develop features, safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository, or fix bugs that you need to fix before you add them to the main project. Branches are like an experimental file that you can work on, just like chemistry. After you are completed, you can merge these branches to the main project, showing all of your other teammates.
